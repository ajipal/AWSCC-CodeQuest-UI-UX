#### 1. UI and UX analyses for Day 1

_(just choose the questions you would like to answer and make it concise)_
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Experience Analysis:**<br/>

-   Which website is easier to find the product you are looking for?<br/>
    Answer:  
    When I searched for the productâ€”Plextone G15 Mark 4â€”Lazada displayed the full details of the product I was looking for with     credible sources and a cheaper price. As a user, I always look for high ratings, verified stores, and affordable items. Thus, Lazada provides more details about the products.

-   Identify any distractions or unnecessary elements that could potentially confuse users.<br/>
    Answer:
     I've noticed in Shopee, it always pops out ads every time I open the application/website or whenever I'm on the platform. As a user, it somewhat irritates me since there are circumstances that I'm just trying to look for products but not planning to buy them.


-   Compare the organization of content between the two platforms. Which between the two platformsâ€™ content is easier to scan and understand?<br/>
    Answer:
    Both give the same hierarchical structure; however, Lazada provides complete details whenever I search for products from verified stores. Additionally, the main icons I always use are at the bottom of our phone display, making it easier to find. Also, there are minimal things that are moving which makes it clean and neat.

<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Interface Analysis:**

-   Is the websitesâ€™ layout and design visually pleasing and consistent with their brand?<br/>
    Answer:
    Shopee gives more engaging and lively designs because of its brand color, while Lazada gives more of a minimalist vibe, making it appealing. Both use a hierarchical layout, placing all sales, discounts, and promos at the top.
    
-   Comment on the responsiveness of both websites across different devices.<br/>
    Answer:
    A. Lazada
    Mobile view: There's a slight animation whenever I refresh the page, and the "My Orders" page sidebar stretches whenever I swipe it.
    Desktop view: We can change the slideshow of photos on the homepage whenever the cursor hovers over it.
    B. Shopee
    Mobile view: There's a lot of text, photos, and videos that are moving on the homepage.
    Desktop view: The response when I hover over the products is much more visible than Lazada.

-   Which do you think is better when it comes to the visual aspect of the website?<br/>
    Answer:
     I will choose Shopee since it gives a lively and engaging interaction with us. However, in terms of cleanliness, I would prefer Lazada since it is clean and its components are not distracting.
